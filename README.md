## About Appnext ##
Appnext offers an open, standards-based integrated platform for mobile app distribution.
Our platform enables publishers to quickly integrate app install ad units, develop native ad promotions and control a fully transparent monetization and distribution experience.

At Appnext, we believe that app discovery is an essential component of any monetization strategy for mobile apps and websites. By suggesting a new app, you are not only delivering interesting content, but also generating a significant revenue stream from each user who installs or reengages with the newly suggested app.

**We empower our partners to create experiences that matter!**
