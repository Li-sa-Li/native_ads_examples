## Examples
### General
This GitHub page will present examples of Native Ads usage created by the Appnext development team. You can use these examples to understand how to use our Native Ads SDK. Appnext has access to the raw advertiser assets (not via ad tags) which allows you to configure to meet most any advertising positions, not only standard IAB banner sizes. You can create your own ads UX using our Native Ads SDK.
